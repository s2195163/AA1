Project Overview:
I provide a thorough analysis of consumer behaviour in this paper using data that was downloaded from the Kaggle website. Using ensemble methods and decision tree analysis, aim to extract insights. This report will cover every step of the procedure, providing a justification for the decisions made and addressing any difficulties encountered during the study. The objective of this case study is to indicate whether the customer had stopped purchasing or not (1 Churn, 0 active) producing predictive modelling like decision trees and ensemble methods such as gradient boosting and random forest.

Role of SAS E-Miner: 
SAS E-Miner is a data mining and predictive analytics tool. Its primary role is to help data scientists, statisticians, and business analysts build and deploy predictive models. It allows users to explore, analyze, and model data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. SAS E-Miner provides a graphical interface for designing, implementing, and evaluating predictive models without the need for extensive programming.

Role of Talend Data Integration:
Talend Data Integration is an open-source data integration tool used for designing and executing data integration processes. Its role is to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from various sources to a target destination. Talend Data Integration supports a wide range of data connectors and provides a visual interface for designing data workflows. It is commonly used for data warehousing, data migration, and other ETL-related tasks.

Role of Talend Data Preparation:
Talend Data Preparation is focused on the data preparation phase of the data processing pipeline. Its primary role is to help users clean, enrich, and shape raw data into a format suitable for analysis or further processing. Talend Data Preparation provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and cleaning data, allowing users to perform tasks such as data profiling, standardization, and handling missing values. It is particularly useful for data analysts and business users who may not have extensive technical skills.
